# Rules for qualifying patient labels for Statistical Process Control (SPC)Charts (daily and weekly aggregate time series data) 
## About SPC Percentage Charts (p-charts)
A p chart is a time series chart showing a percentage with three reference lines- a mean, and an upper and lower control limit which indicate that 99% of the data points fall within these two limits. SPC charts are used in Quality Improvement to view variation in a process over time and to assess whether changes that are made to processes during improvement initiatives are resulting in actual statistically meaningful improvements.

# Constructing the charts


* Build y axis depicting the variable in question (the performance indicator you are interested in) 
* Build x axis depicting time in days/weeks 
* Build central line based on the mean of all data points 
* Build upper and lower control limits to the data 3 sigma ( Ïƒ) above and below the mean
