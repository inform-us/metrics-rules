# Rules for qualifying patient labels for Statistical Process Control (SPC)Charts (daily and weekly aggregate time series data) 
## About SPC Percentage Charts (p-charts)
A p chart is a time series chart showing a percentage with three reference lines- a mean, and an upper and lower control limit which indicate that 99% of the data points fall within these two limits. SPC charts are used in Quality Improvement to view variation in a process over time and to assess whether changes that are made to processes during improvement initiatives are resulting in actual statistically meaningful improvements.

# Constructing the charts

* Build y-axis depicting the variable in question (the performance indicator you are interested in) 
* Build x-axis depicting time in days/weeks 
* Build central line based on the mean of all data points 
* Build upper and lower control limits to the data 3 sigma (Ïƒ) above and below the mean  

## Formulae for calculating control limits

Upper control limit = process mean + 3 square root of process mean x (1-process mean)/ *n* 
Lower control limit = process mean - 3 square root of process mean x (1-process mean)/ *n* 

## Rules for detecting special cause variation, i.e. statistically meaningful variation in the process

# Rule 1 - SHIFT 

 When an SPC chart shows at least 7 data points above or below the mean, denote as a shift using 7 orange diamonds  

# Rule 2 - TREND  

When an SPC chart shows at least 7 ascending or descending data points, denote as a trend using 7 blue squares  

# Rule 3- OUTLIER 

When an SPC chart shows any data point outside of the control limits, denote as an outlier using a red triangle  

 Note: *Control limits are stepped as they reflect the change in sample size of each data point*
